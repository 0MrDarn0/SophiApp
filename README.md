# Deus vult!

The SophiApp functionality will be fully based on the [Sophia Script for Windows 10](https://github.com/farag2/Sophia-Script-for-Windows) logic except some functions and will be written in C#.

# Windows 10 versions support

SophiApp will support only the latest Windows 10 version, 2004 and higher. If you are using a different version, please update it if possible, so as not to upset our testing department. :smile:
