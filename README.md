# :rocket:

We're in search of Ð°n experienced **C# developer** & a **designer** who are really passionate about Windows 10 and want to create an open source Windows 10 tweaker with the best UX/UI design.

# Windows 10 versions support

SophiApp will support only the latest Windows 10 version, 2004 and higher. If you are using a different version, please update it if possible, so as not to upset our testing department. :smile:
